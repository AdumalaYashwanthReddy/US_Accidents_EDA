# US Accidents EDA Project
## Project Description
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the US Accidents Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset provides detailed information about traffic accidents that occurred in the United States, including features like location, time, weather conditions, and accident severity. The goal of this project is to uncover patterns and insights that can help understand accident trends, especially focusing on time, geography, weather, and temperature.

## Dataset
- Source: US Accidents Dataset on Kaggle
- Size: ~7.7 million records from 2016 to 2023
- Features:
Start_Time, End_Time: Timestamps of the accident.
- City, State, Country: Location data.
- Start_Lat, Start_Lng: Geographic coordinates of the accident.
- Temperature(F), Weather_Condition: Weather-related features.
- Severity: Accident severity on a scale of 1 to 4.
- Objective
The main objective of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis and find insights about accidents in the US. Specifically:

- Analyze the start time of accidents to find patterns during the day or week.
- Explore accident distribution by city and identify high-risk locations.
- Analyze latitude and longitude to visualize accident locations.
- Investigate the impact of temperature and weather conditions on accidents.
## Analysis Performed
1. Start Time Analysis:
- Identified peak hours and days with the highest accident occurrences.
2. City Distribution:
- Found the cities with the highest number of accidents.
3. Geographical Analysis:
- Visualized accidents by latitude and longitude to identify accident-prone areas.
4. Weather:
- Investigated which weather conditions, such as rain, fog, cloudy, or clear skies, had the highest accident frequency.
## Findings
- Accident Peaks: Accidents are most frequent during rush hours, especially between 6-9 AM and 3-6 PM.
- City Distribution: A few cities account for a large number of accidents.
- Weather Impact: Weather conditions like cloudy are associated with higher accident rates compared to clear weather.
## Conclusion
This project provides insights into accident patterns in the US, with a focus on weather and timing. Further exploration may include more detailed geographical heatmaps and incorporating additional features for deeper analysis.
